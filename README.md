# Marketplace E-commerce Website

This project involves the creation of a dynamic e-commerce marketplace that integrates APIs, dynamic routing for product details, and performance testing. The development follows a structured plan that spans six days, where each day focuses on a specific aspect of the project.

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to build a modern e-commerce platform that connects product data through APIs, uses dynamic routing for detailed product pages, and implements testing and optimization strategies for performance and error handling. The platform integrates with Sanity CMS for easy content management.

## Day 1 - Business Goals & Data Schema
- **Business Goals**: Defined the core objectives of the e-commerce platform and identified key features.
- **Data Schema**: Designed the initial database schema, including product data fields, CMS setup, and API structures.
- **Submission**: LinkedIn post showcasing the progress or added to the "notes" folder in the project repository.

---

## Day 2 - Planning Technical Foundation
- **Tech Stack**: Chose the technology stack, including Next.js for frontend, Sanity CMS for content management, and external APIs for product data.
- **Architecture**: Defined the technical structure of the app, including API integrations, routing strategy, and the layout for product details pages.
- **Database Setup**: Initialized the Sanity CMS and populated initial product data to begin the API integration.

## Day 3 - API Integration Report
### Report Summary:
- **API Integration Process**: Integrated Sanity CMS with the frontend using Next.js API routes to fetch and display products.
- **Schema Adjustments**: Modified product schema to include additional fields such as images, prices, and descriptions.
- **Migration Steps**: Migrated product data to Sanity CMS and adjusted the schema to accommodate changes in product attributes.

### Submission:
- **API Calls**: Screenshots of successful API calls displaying product data in the frontend.
- **Data in Frontend**: Screenshots showing products populated with data from the Sanity CMS.
- **Code Snippets**: Code examples for API integration and migration scripts.

## Day 4 - Dynamic Routing for Product Page
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routing in Next.js to display detailed product pages by fetching product data using slugs.
- **Search Bar Integration**: Created a search bar component that filters products dynamically based on user input.
- **Frontend Updates**: Updated frontend components to use dynamic routes and ensure product pages are correctly linked.

---

## Day 5 - Testing and Backend Refinement
- **API Testing**: Performed API testing to ensure correct data retrieval and error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling mechanisms to handle failed API calls and display appropriate fallback messages.
- **Testing Report**: Documented all test cases in CSV format, including functional, performance, and security tests.
- **Website Performance Analysis**: Analyzed website performance using tools like Lighthouse

## Day 6 - Deployment and Performance Testing
- **Staging Environment**: Deployed the application to a staging environment using Vercel, ensuring all features work as expected.
- **Performance Testing**: Conducted performance tests and generated reports, including load time and responsiveness.
- **GitHub Repository**: A new GitHub repository was created containing all day-wise documentation, test case reports, and performance testing results.

### Submission:
1. **Staging Environment Deployed Link**: [Staging Environment](<staging-link>)
2. **GitHub Repository**: [GitHub Repository Link](<github-repository-link>)
   - **Documents Folder**: Contains all Day 1 to Day 6 documents.
   - **Test Case Report**: CSV format containing test case results.
